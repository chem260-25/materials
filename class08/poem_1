O, muse of code, in digital domain,
Where bits and bytes in endless chorus play,
There stands bold Linux, free from gilded chain,
A sovereign realm where open truths hold sway.

Thou art the stage where minds unbound may soar,
A beacon bright amid proprietary night;
In every line of code, a mythic lore,
A gift of freedom, shining ever bright.

No tyrant's grasp can mar thy noble art,
For in thy open heart, all souls unite;
Thy kernel beatsâ€”a pulse of common heart,
A symphony of wisdom, pure and right.

O Linux, in thy open, storied scroll,
We find the keys to unlock every soul.
