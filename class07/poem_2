O, muse of code, in digital domain,
Where bits and bytes in endless chorus resound,
There stands bold Linux, free from gilded chain,
A sovereign realm where open truths prevail.

Thou art the stage where minds unbound may soar,
A gleaming beacon in the proprietary night,
In every line of code, a mythic lore,
A boon of liberty, glowing with eternal light.

No tyrant's grasp can mar thy noble art,
For in thy open heart, all souls entwine,
Thy kernel beatsâ€”a pulse of common heart,
A symphony of wisdom, flawless and bright.

O Linux, in thy open, storied scroll,
We unearth the keys to liberate every soul.
